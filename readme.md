# Shopp Templates

This repository houses the templates to be used for Shopp.page.

Each template has its own folder. For now, we'll just assign numbers to them (shopp-1, shopp-2, etc), but later we'll give them real names.

## Install the Dependencies

Make sure you have node and npm installed, then install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Serve a Template

Use the `serve` package to serve the template you want to see. You can target the template by running `serve [template-name]`.

Example:

```bash
serve shopp-1
```

Open a browser tab to `localhost:5000` to see the template.

## Design Files

Here are the links to the designs for each template:
